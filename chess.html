                        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#FF0000; padding: 1em;"><b>Not long ago, I had no idea what chess was. The only way I was associated with it was because my sister entered a chess club in elementary school. But even then, I still had no idea what chess was and what doors and opportunities could arise. At the time I was around 7, and my sister was in the 5th grade. She had just recently joined the chess club for whatever reason. However that didn’t last long, for whatever reason, chess club in my elementary school ended. Therefore, I didn’t know how to play chess until I was around 11. It was only until I entered the seeall academy that I learned and gained a passion for chess. My parents enrolled me in this after-school programmed called FIAO at seeall. It’s this afterschool program where kids can learn robotics, get help with school subjects, play sports, and last but not least, play chess. It was in this program where I met my future chess coach, Mr. Moy. {The rest of this story is on <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ttsc5ND6L9kQ65_aILf-IKBwUhIeN9CjjfcbABmILA/edit?usp=sharing"> my letter to mr.cullman</a> </p>
